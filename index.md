# No Appetite For Apartheid

The NA4A Campaign is a national campaign started by the Palestine Solidarity Working Group [link]. 
Our local version of the campaign is started by the NC Triangle DSA chapter. 

We believe that giving people an understanding of the efficacy of boycotts, the way that certain spending may be complicit in apartheid and genocide, equips them with the ability to map out power materially, understand global systems of oppression and subjugation, and build local power.

We believe that through building community and increasing local power we can be more equipped to meet 
other groups at sites of struggle and strengthen to movement towards Palestinian liberation. 

We believe in using economic pressure against the israeli economy to realize change under capitalism, and we realize that this is a multi-pronged struggle, where boycotting is just one way to make an impact. 


## Goals
We aim to make the Triangle an apartheid-free zone where individuals do not buy israeli products and stores do not sell 
israeli products.

We believe that in pursuit of this goal, we can exert pressure on the israeli economy. In the long term we act 
towards an end to the israeli occupation and a free Palestine.
