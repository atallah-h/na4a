Our campaign follows the same spirit of the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction movement ([BDS](https://bdsmovement.net/)).
While the BDS movement has targets in different categories, No Appetite for Apartheid focuses primarily on the 
agricultural sector. We base our approach on the fact that the US is a major importer of israeli food products, and we 
believe that targeting these companies can make a significant impact on the genocidal israeli economy. These products are 
grown on stolen land, including on illegal settlements, and these companies exploit Palestinian labor. In many cases,
the profits and taxes from these companies are used to fund the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF). 

We believe that this focus on food products complements the divestment and boycott work that targets other sectors. 
While the NA4A campaign is focused on food, the broader coalition can expand its goals beyond this sector. 
It is our hope that we will support the related efforts by our coalition partners to put pressure on the israeli economy 
in order to stop the genocide of Palestinians, end the occupation, and support a free Palestine.

## Individual pledges - how we engage individual community members
We canvass and hand out flyers at events.

We aim to grow individualsâ€™ understanding of their role in global systems through teach-ins and educational content 
on our Instagram page.

## Business pledges - how we engage local businesses 
We canvass and talk to store owners and employees.

We equip store owners with information on products to avoid and offer alternatives to israeli goods.

We foster relationships with local, Palestinian store owners and help them maintain connections to the broader community.
